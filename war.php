        <h2>War on London</h2>

                <p>War in the United Kingdom has been documented throughout many centuries. While I could tell
                    you about nearly all the battles that involved the United Kingdom, I would prefer to talk
                    strictly about London here. More history about the grand U.K. can be found <a href="./grading.php" class="connector">here</a>.

                    The first attack on London was throughout the first World War. The attacks were carried out
                    by German air campaigns, using airships to launch bombs from above at the English soil
                    below. Of course technology was not very good back then, and pilots were not as trained.
                    Many bombs that the German pilots threw landed miles off target. They did get better as the
                    war went on however. At one point in 1915, the Germans hit St Paulâ€™s Cathedral, which caused
                    a massive fire and greatly damaged the beloved monument. Throughout World War One, the
                    Germans moved to using Zeppelins as their method of bombing, which we can see through
                    British propaganda.

                <p>Moving onto the biggest attack ever to London, which occurred during World War Two, The
                    London Blitz. These were horrific bombings, happening for 8 whole months against the United
                    Kingdom. The Germans systematically bombed London to spread panic and hysteria to the strong
                    country. At one point, Germany bombed London every night for 56 nights to make the country
                    go into a widespread panic. This also caused what is now known as the Second Great Fire of
                    London, a massive firestorm. This is because Germany had stocked their pilots with
                    incendiary bombs rather than the explosives. The incendiary bombs ended up hitting a lumber
                    mill, causing a massive fire which was unable to be put out due to a water shortage by
                    London firefighters.This killed nearly 250 civilians, 12 being the firefighters. Overall,
                    the blitz killed around 30,000 civilians and left the city in mass destruction. London did
                    hold strong however, and with planned attacks and defenses, making Germany abandon these
                    tactics for good.
